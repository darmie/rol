### 4. **Writing LROL Rules**

This section provides a guide to constructing LROL models, including syntax and best practices. An LROL rule defines a series of **evaluations** (conditions) and **actions** (responses) based on specified thresholds. Rules are built in JSON, making them readable, modifiable, and easy to deploy across platforms.

---

#### **Basic Rule Format**
Each LROL rule follows a consistent JSON structure with fields that define the rule’s intent, criteria, and actions.

**Basic Rule Structure**:
```json
{
  "model_id": "UNIQUE-ID",
  "name": "Rule Name",
  "description": "Detailed description of the rule",
  "threshold": 0.85,
  "evaluations": [],
  "actions": []
}
```
The example above outlines a minimal structure, with placeholders for unique elements.

#### **Defining Evaluations**
Evaluations are the primary building blocks, specifying conditions or criteria for the rule to assess. **Evaluations** are stored in an array within the `evaluations` field, and each evaluation includes:
- **Type**: Determines the evaluation method (e.g., `comparison`, `aggregation`).
- **Conditions**: Defines criteria, such as operators and values, that trigger specific evaluations.

**Example**:
```json
"evaluations": [
  {
    "name": "Amount_Check",
    "type": "comparison",
    "left": "transaction_amount",
    "operator": ">",
    "right": 5000
  }
]
```
In this example, the evaluation checks if the `transaction_amount` exceeds 5,000.

---

#### **Setting Thresholds and Weights**
The **threshold** field specifies the confidence level required to trigger the rule. For example, a threshold of `0.85` indicates an 85% confidence level needed to activate the rule’s actions.

Weights can be applied to evaluations within the `weight` field to prioritize specific evaluations. Higher weights mean greater influence in reaching the threshold.

**Example with Weights**:
```json
{
  "model_id": "HIGH-RISK-001",
  "threshold": 0.9,
  "evaluations": [
    {
      "name": "High_Amount_Check",
      "type": "comparison",
      "left": "transaction_amount",
      "operator": ">",
      "right": 10000,
      "weight": 5
    }
  ]
}
```
