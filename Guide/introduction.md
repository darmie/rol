### 1. **Introduction**

**Loci Risk Orchestration Language (LROL)** is a domain-specific language designed to help organizations standardize, structure, and scale fraud detection and risk management rules across diverse financial systems. By offering a clear, JSON-based syntax, LROL enables compliance, risk, and fraud teams to create rules that are adaptable, transparent, and platform-agnostic.

LROL addresses common challenges in risk management by:
- Creating a unified framework for defining fraud rules.
- Simplifying rule deployment across different platforms.
- Ensuring auditability and regulatory compliance with clear, traceable rules.
