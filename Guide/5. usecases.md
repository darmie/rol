### 5. **Use Cases**

LROL is highly adaptable, supporting a range of fraud detection and risk management scenarios. This section provides examples to illustrate how LROL can be applied across different contexts, including transaction monitoring, AML compliance, and high-risk behaviors.

#### **Fraud Detection Scenarios**

1. **Transaction Velocity Monitoring**
   - **Objective**: Detect unusual transaction volumes over short periods, often signaling account takeover or abuse.
   - **Example**: Flag accounts with high-value transactions within a 15-minute window when they exceed a cumulative amount threshold.
   - **Sample Rule**:
     ```json
     {
       "model_id": "VEL-001",
       "name": "Transaction Velocity Check",
       "threshold": 0.85,
       "evaluations": [
         {
           "name": "Velocity_Sum",
           "type": "aggregation",
           "aggregation": "SUM",
           "field": "transaction_amount",
           "conditions": [
             {
               "type": "comparison",
               "left": "datetime(transaction.timestamp)",
               "operator": ">=",
               "right": "datetime(now, '-15 minutes')"
             }
           ],
           "weight": 4
         }
       ],
       "actions": [
         {
           "type": "flag_transaction",
           "reason": "Unusual transaction volume detected."
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

2. **Cross-Border High-Risk Payment Detection**
   - **Objective**: Identify large cross-border transactions originating from high-risk countries.
   - **Example**: Flag transactions over $10,000 from specific high-risk regions.
   - **Sample Rule**:
     ```json
     {
       "model_id": "CB-HIGH-001",
       "name": "Cross-Border High-Value Payment",
       "threshold": 0.9,
       "evaluations": [
         {
           "name": "Amount_Check",
           "type": "comparison",
           "left": "transaction_amount",
           "operator": ">",
           "right": 10000,
           "weight": 5
         },
         {
           "name": "Country_Check",
           "type": "comparison",
           "left": "origin_country",
           "operator": "IN",
           "right": ["Country_X", "Country_Y"],
           "weight": 3
         }
       ],
       "actions": [
         {
           "type": "flag_transaction",
           "reason": "High-value cross-border transaction flagged."
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

3. **Immediate Withdrawal Detection After Receiving Funds**
   - **Objective**: Flag transactions that withdraw or transfer an amount within 5 minutes of a recent incoming transaction that was at least 10% larger than the withdrawal amount.
   - **Example**: If a $5,500 deposit occurs, flag any withdrawal of $5,000 or less within 5 minutes.
   - **Sample Rule**:
     ```json
     {
       "model_id": "WITHDRAW-DEPOSIT-003",
       "name": "Immediate Withdrawal After Deposit",
       "threshold": 0.9,
       "evaluations": [
         {
           "name": "Recent_Deposit_Check",
           "type": "comparison",
           "left": "transaction_type",
           "operator": "=",
           "right": "deposit",
           "conditions": [
             {
               "type": "comparison",
               "left": "datetime(transaction.timestamp)",
               "operator": ">=",
               "right": "datetime(now, '-5 minutes')"
             }
           ],
           "weight": 4
         },
         {
           "name": "Amount_Comparison_Check",
           "type": "comparison",
           "left": "transaction_amount",
           "operator": "<=",
           "right": "recent_transaction.amount * 0.9",
           "weight": 5
         }
       ],
       "actions": [
         {
           "type": "flag_transaction",
           "reason": "Withdrawal flagged due to immediate follow-up after large deposit."
         }
       ]
     }
     ```

#### **Risk Management Scenarios**

1. **Industry Exposure Monitoring**
   - **Objective**: Monitor transactions with high-risk industries (e.g., gambling, cryptocurrency) to assess exposure.
   - **Example**: Flag transactions over $10,000 with entities in high-risk sectors.
   - **Sample Rule**:
     ```json
     {
       "model_id": "IND-RISK-001",
       "name": "High-Risk Industry Exposure",
       "threshold": 0.75,
       "evaluations": [
         {
           "name": "Industry_Check",
           "type": "comparison",
           "left": "merchant_industry",
           "operator": "IN",
           "right": ["Gambling", "Cryptocurrency"],
           "weight": 3
         },
         {
           "name": "Transaction_Amount_Check",
           "type": "comparison",
           "left": "transaction_amount",
           "operator": ">",
           "right": 10000,
           "weight": 2
         }
       ],
       "actions": [
         {
           "type": "flag_transaction",
           "reason": "Transaction flagged due to high-risk industry exposure."
         }
       ]
     }
     ```
